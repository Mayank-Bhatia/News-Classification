# News-Classification
Classifying news headlines.

The purpose of this project is to correctly classify news headlines by training models on the News Aggregator Dataset found in the UCI ML Repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/News+Aggregator.

I will also include a function that allows the input of custom headlines (fake or real) and returns the suitable category.
